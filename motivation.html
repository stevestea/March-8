        What's wrong? I know today might not be going the way you hoped,
        but I just want to remind you how strong and incredible you are. Bad
        days don’t define you, and you’ve overcome so much before—you’ll get
        through this too. No matter what, you have people who care about you,
        and I’m always here for you."<br>"Take it easy on yourself, and don’t
        forget that brighter moments are ahead. You deserve happiness, love, and
        all the good things coming your way. You’ve got this!
